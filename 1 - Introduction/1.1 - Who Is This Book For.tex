This book is intended for everyone.
\newline
\\
This book is meant to be useful to programmers of all levels, those who have never programmed before, those who are just
getting started and even those who have been programming for years.
Since this resource will always be growing and changing as the industry changes the information should always be in some
way applicable for all developers.
\newline
\\
Those who are familiar with programming are most likely going to be able to skip the chapter "Getting Started" and in
some cases might not read the book in sequential order, but rather skip around picking and choosing which sections are
applicable to them.
