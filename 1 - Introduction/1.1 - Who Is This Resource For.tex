This resource is intended for everyone.
\par

This resource is meant to be useful to programmers of all levels, those who have never programmed before, those who are just
getting started and even those who have been programming for years.
Since this resource will always be growing and changing as the industry changes the information should always be in some
way applicable for all developers.
\par

Those who are familiar with programming are most likely going to be able to skip the chapter "Getting Started" and in
some cases might not read the resource in sequential order, but rather skip around picking and choosing which sections are
applicable to them.
