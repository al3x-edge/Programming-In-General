Greetings and welcome to Programming In General. This is a book that I started writting to try and provide
free resources to those who either wanted to learn programming or who wanted to further their knowledge of
programming.
\newline
\\
This book is provided completely free to anyone who wishes to use it.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed writting it.
